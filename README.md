# homsassistant-solax-modbus
SolaX Power Modbus custom_component for Home Assistant
 
# Installation
Copy the folder and contents of solax_modbus into to your home-assistant config/custom_components folder.
After reboot of Home-Assistant, this integration can be configured through the integration setup UI

# Known Issues

1. ~~Tick boxes in configflow have no Text.~~ - Fixed!
2. ~~Only supports reading at the moment., writing to registers not net implemented.~~ Write support for Run Mode, Charge from Grid Mode, Min Battery Capacity & Charge / Discharge rate of battery
3. ~~Gen3 X3 Not yet implemented.~~ Gen3 X3 - Supported.
4. ~~Only supports Modbus over TCP. Serial / RS485 not yet implemented.~~ Serial / RS485 now supported.
5. ~~The sensors do not support the new "Energy" Dashboard in 2021.08.x and onwards.~~ Sensors now support the new "Energy" Dashboard in 2021.08.x and onwards. (Gen3 X1 & X3 only, Gen 2 doesn't support it unfortunately. Look at [solar_bits.yaml](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/blob/master/packages/solar_bits.yaml) for how to setup the Integration - Integration)
6. You can only have one connection to the inverter, so you can't use this and one of my yaml [packages](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/tree/master/packages) at the same time.
7. Possible Warnings about blocking call in the event loop (in systems with serial modbus connection).

## Version 0.4.0

# ATTENTION: Gen4 is Work in progress - only tested for X3, Gen4 X1 not tested - Use at your own risk !!!!
Great thanks to @infradom for help adding in Serial Modbus and the Gen 4
- Add support for X3 Gen4 (X1 Gen4 should work also, but completely untested)
- Add support for serial Modbus RTU connection (needed as the Gen4 modbus is not accessible over TCPIP)
I am using a low-cost 2‚Ç¨ usb-to-RS485 adapter. By default Gen4 device is set to 19200 baud.

If you are trying this on a non Hybrid (X1 Air, X1 Mini, X1 Boost) start off without setting any of the tick boxes and see what values you have.

## Version 0.4.1
Fixed the following:
- number.solax_battery_minimum_capacity now survives restart of HA

## Version 0.4.2
Fixed the following:
Gen2 X1
- sensor.solax_battery_charge_float_voltage
- sensor.solax_battery_discharge_cut_off_voltage
- sensor.solax_export_control_user_limit

Gen2 & Gen3
- select.solax_run_mode_select now select.solax_charger_use_mode
- select.solax_grid_charge_select now select.solax_allow_grid_charge
Changed response from sensor.solax_allow_grid_charge
- "Forbidden"
- "Charger Time 1"
- "Charger Time 2"
- "Both Charger Time's"

to
- "Both Forbidden",
- "Period 1 Allowed",
- "Period 2 Allowed",
- "Both Allowed
Now matches the state of select.solax_allow_grid_charge
- select.solax_charger_use_mode & select.solax_allow_grid_charge survies a restart of HA and also responds to changes made through the SolaX Cloud portal

Set the following to be hidden as default due to them being duplicates of select / number entries
- sensor.solax_allow_grid_charge
- sensor.solax_battery_charge_max_current
- sensor.solax_battery_discharge_max_current
- sensor.solax_battery_minimum_capacity
- sensor.solax_charger_use_mode
