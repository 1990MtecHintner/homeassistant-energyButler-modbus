# Installation

<B>Preferred Option</B>

You can add this custom_component directly through HACS, if you have HACS installed on your Home Assistant instance.

<B>Alternatively</B>

Download the zip / tar.gz from the release page.
- Extract the contents of solax_modbus into to your home-assistant config/custom_components folder.

If you manually clone the repository you may end up mid code update!

~~Copy the folder and contents of solax_modbus into to your home-assistant config/custom_components folder.~~


<B>Post Installation</B>

After reboot of Home-Assistant, this integration can be configured through the integration setup UI

Any manual updates / HACS updates require a restart of Home Assistant to take effect.
- Any major changes might require deleting the Integration from the Integration page and adding again. If you name the Integration exactly the same including the Area if set, you should retain the same entity naming bar any name changes in the release. (Refer to the release notes for any naming change)

If the Integration fails to load with the following error in your log "unrecognized inverter type - serial number : {your_serial_number_here}"
Please see [Discussion #26](https://github.com/wills106/homsassistant-solax-modbus/discussions/26) providing the details asked for.

<B>Inverter never connected to the Cloud / possibly after a firmware update:</B>
- If you can read values, but unable to adjust select / number you need to press the "Unlock Inverter" button.
- Might need performing again following a full Power Cycle

# Known Issues

1. You can only have one connection to the inverter, so you can't use this and one of my yaml [packages](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/tree/master/packages) at the same time for writing to registers.
2. Possible Warnings about blocking call in the event loop (in systems with serial modbus connection).
3. Please check the Todo List under discussions for other known issues and what's being worked on.
4. You need to manually add select and number entries to your lovelace card if you manually control your front end.
