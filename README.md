# homsassistant-solax-modbus
SolaX Power Modbus custom_component for Home Assistant

 DO NOT USE THIS FORK CODE YET !!!! Work in progress - 
 
 
# Installation
Copy the folder and contents of solax_modbus into to your home-assistant config/custom_components folder.
After reboot of Home-Assistant, this integration can be configured through the integration setup UI

# Known Issues

1. ~~Tick boxes in configflow have no Text.~~ - Fixed!
2. ~~Only supports reading at the moment., writing to registers not net implemented.~~ Write support for Run Mode, Charge from Grid Mode, Min Battery Capacity & Charge / Discharge rate of battery
3. ~~Gen3 X3 Not yet implemented.~~ Gen3 X3 - Supported.
4. Only supports Modbus over TCP. Serial / RS485 not yet implemented.
5. ~~The sensors do not support the new "Energy" Dashboard in 2021.08.x and onwards.~~ Sensors now support the new "Energy" Dashboard in 2021.08.x and onwards. (Gen3 X1 & X3 only, Gen 2 doesn't support it unfortunately. Look at [solar_bits.yaml](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/blob/master/packages/solar_bits.yaml) for how to setup the Integration - Integration)
6. You can only have one connection to the inverter, so you can't use this and one of my yaml [packages](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-config/tree/master/packages) at the same time.

SolaX Today's Export Energy - Rounded to two places and moved to Gen3 only

Added missing sensors to Gen3 X3
- Battery Current Charge
- Battery Voltage Charge

## Version 0.2.2

Converted all Sensors to use SensorEntityDescription

Removed Optional Sensors - Now form part of the main Sensor Group, but disabled by default

Updated Energy Dashboard compatibility for 2021.9x Version of Home Assistant

Renamed "Input Energy Charge Today" & "Output Energy Charge Today" to "Battery Input Energy Today" & "Battery Output Energy Today" Now compatible with the Energy Dashboard

## Version 0.3.0

Write Support!
- Run Mode
- Charge periods in Force Time Use Mode
- Min Battery Capacity
- Charge / Discharge rate of battery

@mickemartinsson Has done a Swedish Translation

Default names of new select / number
- select.solax_run_mode_select
- select.solax_grid_charge_select
- number.solax_battery_minimum_capacity
- number.solax_battery_charge
- number.solax_battery_discharge

Battery Charge/Discharge Limits
Gen 2 - 50Amp (I don't know if this applies to all Batteries on the Gen 2 or just the Pylon Tech. Be very careful!)
Every other setup 20Amp

Fixed House Load showing Zero when charging from the Grid. Should also fix House Load showing zero when Battery is empty.

## Version xxx
- Add support for X3 Gen4 (X1 Gen4 should work also, but completely untested)
- Add support for serial Modbus RTU connection (needed as the Gen4 modbus is not accessible over TCPIP)
I am using a low-cost 2‚Ç¨ usb-to-RS485 adapter. By default Gen4 device is set to 19200 baud.
